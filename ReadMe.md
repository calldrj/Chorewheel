User Stories:

The application is for average PC users who want to control their to-do list on a computer.  The user can be an ambitious 
    students in middle or high school, or a person who is just learning how to use a computer, or even high-power PC user.
As a user, I want a to-do list so that I can add tasks to.

As a user, I want to be able to view my list in different ways including by priority and category.
As a power user, I want to be able to customize the names of the categories.
As a user, I want to the program to pick a task for me at random.
As a user, I want my tasks to have default priorities if I donâ€™t want to add them specifically.

Motivation:

Our team was motivated to make a simple desktop app in order to track and prioritize our tasks.  

Build Status:

The App is currently in Beta testing to evaluate any areas where improvement is needed.

Tech Used:

We initially programmed in Visual Studio and then converted our code to a UI interface with QT.

Features:

Our project features adding, editing, checking off, and deleting items on a to-do list.  The items can be sorted by due date 
    or priority rating.  We added a special randomization feature which displays a random task off the list on command for users 
    who do not want to choose what to do next.
